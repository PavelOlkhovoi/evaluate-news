# Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This is my second asynchronous app for self-education. The app allows users to evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing. I have built the app by vanilla JS, Webpack, Express, Jest and Service Workers.

## Usage
Just put a link to an article and get the result with the following characteristics: "Agreement", "Subjectivity", "Confidence","Irony".
